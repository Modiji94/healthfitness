package com.example.medicalfitness.services;

public interface HealthServices
{

	@Service
	public class ElderlyHealthService {
	    public void performRegularHealthCheckup() {
	        // Code for performing regular health check-ups
	    }

	    public void provideNutritionGuidance() {
	        // Code for providing nutrition guidance
	    }

	    public void encouragePhysicalActivity() {
	        // Code for encouraging physical activity
	    }

	    // Define other methods for additional health-related aspects
	}
	Implement the method logic: Inside each method, implement the necessary logic to perform the specific health-related task. For example, in the performRegularHealthCheckup method, you can call the necessary APIs or services to schedule and conduct regular health check-ups.

	Define dependencies: If your service requires interactions with other components or services, define those dependencies within the service class using constructor injection or @Autowired annotation.

	java
	Copy code
	@Service
	public class ElderlyHealthService {
	    private final HealthCheckupService healthCheckupService;

	    @Autowired
	    public ElderlyHealthService(HealthCheckupService healthCheckupService) {
	        this.healthCheckupService = healthCheckupService;
	    }

	    // ...
	}
	Use the service in your application: Inject the ElderlyHealthService into the appropriate controller or other components where you want to utilize the service's functionality.

	java
	Copy code
	@RestController
	public class UserController {
	    private final ElderlyHealthService elderlyHealthService;

	    @Autowired
	    public UserController(ElderlyHealthService elderlyHealthService) {
	        this.elderlyHealthService = elderlyHealthService;
	    }

	    // Use the elderlyHealthService methods within your controller
	}
	By following these steps, you can create a service in your Spring Boot application dedicated to promoting the health of an older lady. This service can encapsulate various health-related functionalities, and you can utilize it within your application's components as needed.
